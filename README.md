A soft real-time interactive simulation and visualization framework in AR for robotic systems based on ROS
This project allows you to integrate Augmented Reality / Mixed Reality (AR/MR) applications in your ROS based robotic system easily. 
It provides functionalities for an easy setup and configuration, utilizes commonly used tools and standards (urdf files, etc.) and is easily extendable.

### Please read our [Wiki](https://github.com/EricVoll/ARbotics/wiki/Project-Architecture-and-Overview) explaining the architecture and inner workings 
### (Also contains a detailled "_[How to get started](https://github.com/EricVoll/ARbotics/wiki/How-to-get-started)_" Section)

This project was originally started as a lecture project at ETH in cooperation with Microsoft Mixed Reality and AI Lab ZÃ¼rich.
